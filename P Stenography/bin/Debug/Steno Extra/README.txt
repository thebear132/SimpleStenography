Run the program, before you do anything more make sure that startImage or modifiedImage are present in the Steno Extra folder
startImage.jpg 		(The original file, the encrypted file will be based on, you need to place it yourself)
modifiedImage.png 	(The new encrypted file the program will generate. This is also the one you need to decode)
